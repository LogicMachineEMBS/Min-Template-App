# Minimum Template Apps for LogicMachine

This repository contains two minimalistic single-page application templates for **LogicMachine** <br>

1.) **Notes Pico**, the simplest, using Pico CSS for a lightweight, semantic UI without JavaScript dependencies, <br>
and <br>
2.) **Notes**, a simple yet feature-rich version with Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript for a polished, interactive design.

Both apps contain a single index.lp file, combining Lua backend 
logic and HTML templating, with detailed comments and README files 
for easy modification; the entire source code can be copied and 
pasted for AI-driven analysis or enhancements.

Difference: <br>
**Notes Pico** is ultra-light and classless, <br>
while **Notes** offers richer components and interactivity
but requires more markup.
